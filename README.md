# My Store app 

In the MyStore project, I built a robust e-commerce app using React for the front end and used fake store api at the backend. I implemented dynamic product listings, search, multi-language support, and responsive design, utilizing React context for state management. The project stands out for its scalable architecture and seamless real-time features.
